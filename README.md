# Location Based Privacy Using Cloaking Algorithm
# Abstract
Participatory sensing is a type of data collection that relies on the participation of individuals to gather data about a particular
environment or phenomenon. One important aspect of participatory sensing is preserving the privacy of the individuals who are participating in the data collection process. This can be particularly challenging in applications where location data is being collected, as this type of data can be highly sensitive and revealing. In this literature survey, we will explore the various approaches that have been proposed to address location privacy in participatory sensing applications.
